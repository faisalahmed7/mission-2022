                A mission statement is not enough. Churches need a honing process so that core ideas, core initiatives,
                and core activities embrace the mission. Utilizing a mission filter question or statement can
                consistently focus everyone’s attention and energy on where they are going and why. Now my main mission
                is to become a full-stack web developer.

                As a developer, I think there should be no limits of thinking to build a new software or application.
                Always try to do new thing or to build a new idea for the betterment of the people by using the modern
                technology. In future one person can't do anything without the help of the technology. </p> <br>

                When people ask me what the biggest trend on the web is, I tell them globalization. Web services are
                being used globally and they are increasingly being built globally. There is no place in the world that
                has a lock on talent, ideas, and execution. Web development is a global phenomenon.
